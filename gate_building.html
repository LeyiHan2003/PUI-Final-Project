          <br>The gate of the Quadrangle symbolizes the ranking of the house and the status of the
            owner. The shape, form and depth of the gate has strict regulations in ancient China.</br> <br>The
            gate buildings are mostly located in the southeast corner and open to the
            south. This is because in the Eight Diagrams, the southeast is in the "Sung" position,
            which is the most auspicious.  </br>

                quadrangles where highly ranked government officials in ancient China
                lived in. Guang Liang gate has the largest base and widest space in front of the
                wooden door. Its door frame is positioned between two middle columns, dividing the gate room
                in two halves.</div>

            <div class="carousel_description">
              <div class ="carousel_text">Jin Zhu gate is ranked below Guang Liang Gate and above Ru Yi Gate; it
                appears at where rich families live. Its doorframe is close to the outside than
                Guang Liang gate, positioned between two hypostyle columns, pushed
                forwards for about 1.3 m, shrinking the space before the door. Suzhou-styled
                paintings often appear on the wooden doorframe of Jin Zhu gates, showing
                the residents' aesthetic tastes.</div>

              <div class ="carousel_text">Most of the middle sized quadrangles have RuYi gates built; the most common gate
                building in Hutongs is also RuYi gates. Its door is set at the outer columns, and the
                wooden door is set inside the brick wall. Above the wooden door are beautiful and
                complex brick carvings, which are particularly detailed on the door heads and the
                qiang yan. On the wooden clasps there are also wood carvings. Most RuYi gates are
                built in the Qing Dynasty and some are built in the People’s Republic period. Its
                name “Ruyi” comes from the commonly seen Ruyi patterns on the brick carvings and
                the Chinese characters “如意”, which often appear on the clasps, meaning “good
                fortunes as one wishes”.

                are similar to Jinzhu gates and Guang Liang gates, except that there is no
                sparrow brace and have fewer decorations. The owner living in quadrangles
                with such doors usually do not hold positions in the government, but are rich

                or Quadrangles with only three sides, which commonly have Embedded gates
                gates. It is small in size, the door is embedded inside the wall,
                and has a simple appearance. The walls of some embedded gates are
                built with broken bricks and are of low quality, so Pekingese call these
                gate buildings “walnut pastry”.</div>

                <div class ="carousel_text">From later Qing dynasty until People’s Republic period, traditional northern
                    chinese architecture was greatly affected by western culture, and many western –
                    styled gate buildings appeared in Hutongs. These western-styles gates show both
                    western and Chinese architectural features: most gates keep traditional wooden doors,
                    cymbal shaped knockers, brick-carvings and door pillow stones, but there are western
                    styled decorations on the walls and the door head. The earliest western-styled gates
                    are built in YuanMing Yuan (the Winter palace), therefore Pekingese also call these
                    gates YuanMing Yuan gates.
